# YouTube Clone Project

This is a YouTube clone project built using ReactJS, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, and React Router DOM. The project utilizes the YouTube API to fetch and display data on the screen, including search results, video details, and comments. It also includes additional features such as search suggestions, debouncing for optimized search, a live chat, and a dummy comments section. The project aims to replicate the core functionalities of YouTube, allowing users to search for videos, watch them, and interact with other users through comments and live chat.

## Tech Stack

The project is built using the following technologies:

- *ReactJS:* A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It enables the creation of reusable UI components and provides a declarative approach to building UIs.
- *Redux Toolkit:* A library that simplifies the management of application state in Redux. It provides tools and abstractions to handle actions, reducers, and store setup efficiently.
- *Tailwind CSS:* A utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-designed classes to style your application. It allows for rapid UI development with minimal CSS code.
- *React Router DOM:* A library that enables client-side routing in React applications. It provides a declarative way to define routes and navigate between different views/components.

## Features

The YouTube clone project includes the following features:

1. *YouTube API Integration:* The project uses the YouTube API to fetch and display video data, including search results, video details, and comments.

2. *Search with Suggestions:* Users can search for videos using the search bar, and the project provides search suggestions as the user types to enhance the search experience.

3. *Debouncing for Optimized Search:* To optimize search performance and reduce unnecessary API requests, the project implements debouncing, which delays the API request until the user pauses typing.

4. *Live Chat:* The project includes a live chat feature that allows users to engage in real-time conversations while watching a video. Users can send messages, view chat history, and see new messages as they arrive.

5. *Dummy Comments Section:* Users can view and interact with a dummy comments section associated with each video. They can read existing comments, add new comments, and reply to other users' comments.

6. *Watch Page:* The project includes a dedicated watch page where users can watch videos and access relevant information such as video description, view count, likes, and dislikes.
